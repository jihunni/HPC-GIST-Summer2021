* Now, it is time for you to prepare Final Report. Please check the syllabus. 

- **Final Report** (20%)
  - You will be asked to write and submit a final report of 2~3 pages (but I prefer to read a long-report like 5-6 pages).
  - If you have been working on a specific research project,
    - provide research background,
    - survey how HPC is used in your research area,
    - and propose your approach and solution to accelerate your research.
  - If you do not have a research topic yet,
    - search your interesting topic (e.g., Covid19 + HPC) literatures and review those papers intensively,
    - review one paper or multiple papers on the topic,
    - and provide your thoughts and critiques.

- Requirements
  - Use Overleaf online LaTex and share ([How to share a project](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Sharing_a_project)) it with me (ted.ahn@slu.edu).

- Due and submit
  - By August 6th (Friday) 11:59 pm
  - Just share it with me and email me (gist account)
