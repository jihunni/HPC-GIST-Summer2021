## Problem
Suppose the runtime of a  serial problem is given by T<sub>serial</sub> = n<sup>2</sup>, where the units of the runtime is in microseconds. Suppose that a parallelization of this program has runtime T<sub>parallel</sub> = (n<sup>2</sup>/p)+log2(p). Write a C++ program that finds the speedups and efficiencies of this program for various values of *n* and *p*. Run your program with *n* = 10, 20, 40, 80, ..., 320, and *p* = 1, 2, 4, 8,..., 128. Describe what happens to the speedups and efficiencies as *p* is increased and *n* is held fixed. Describe what happens when *p* is fixed and *n* is increased.
