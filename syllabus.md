## Overview

### Catalog Description

High-performance computing (HPC) refers to a specialized use of processor features, multiple cores, memory, graphic cards, accelerators, clusters, supercomputers, and everything from software to hardware to speed up computations. This course introduces state-of-the-art HPC technologies and parallel programming skills for them.

### Class Meeting Time/Location

### Credits/Pre-requisites
**Credits**: 3 Credits  
**Pre-requisites**: Data Structures using C++ (required); Algorithms (recommended)  
(Exceptions if non-cs major students have strong programming skills and computer/numerical concepts with enthusiasm for learning HPC)  
**Overall requirements: Students will be expected to have knowledge of algorithms and data structures, and linear algebra at an undergraduate level. Students are expected to be proficient in either Python, C, C++, or FORTRAN. Students should also be familiar with the Unix/Linux environment.  

### Topical Outline
Main topics include basic HPC hardware architectures, parallel programming languages, new trends of HPC, and more. The contents of the course provide a balance of theoretical and practical aspects in parallel computing. A student of this course is expected to develop the right skills to design parallel applications and to effectively use modern HPC platforms.
* Introduce High-Performance Computing (HPC)
* Profiling applications for run time and parallel speed-up
* Brief introduction of computer organization and HPC architecture
* Shared-memory programming with OpenMP
* GPU programming with CUDA
* Distributed-memory programming with MPI
* Cloud Computing and Apache Spark

### Student Learning Outcomes

After successfully complete this course, students are expected to:
* Understand fundamental concepts and new trends of high-performance computing
* Optimize software to take advantage of processor feature
* Design, implement, and analyze programs via OpenMP for shared-memory system
* Design, implement, and analyze programs via MPI for distributed-memory system
* Understand the concept and implement simple GPU programs with CUDA
* Learn cutting-edge big-data cloud-computing framework using Apache Spark
* Learn ability to decide optimization or parallelize of existing applications

## Grading

### Graded Work
- **Homework and Unit Exam Assignments** (70%)
  - There will be written and programming assignments in a variety of format assignments during the course. Maximum points of the assignments could be different.
  - Check each assignment submission due carefully and submit it on time.

- **Final Report** (20%)
  - You will be asked to write and submit a final report of 2~3 pages.
  - If you have been working on a specific research project, 
    - Provide research background.
    - Survey how HPC is used in your research area.
    - Propose your approach and solution to accelerate your research.
  - If you do not have a research topic yet, 
    - Search your interesting topic (e.g., Covid19 + HPC) literatures and review those papers intensively.
    - You can review one paper or multiple papers on the topic.
    - You also have to provide your thoughts and critiques.

- **Attendance and Activities** (10%)
  - If you cannot join synchronous lectures, you should contact me in advance to provide a reason for the absence.
  - If not, -0.5 point for each absence. 

### Percentages
Letter grades will be based on each students overall percentage of awarded points according to the following formula.

- Overall points >= 90 %: A+
- 80 % <= Overall points < 90 %: A
- 70 % <= Overall points < 80 %: B+
- 60 % <= Overall points < 70 %: B
- 50 % <= Overall points < 60 %: C
- 40 % <= Overall points < 50 %: D
- Overall points < 40 %: F

### Extra Credit
In general, extra credit will not be assigned in this class.

Upon occasion (and solely at the instructor's discretion), some small extra credit activities may be included, either by announcement in class or as part of an assignment. Please keep in mind that the extra credit is unlikely to significantly affect your grade; if you are concerned about your final grade, it is much better to focus your energy on the regular assignments. Extra credit is solely designed to provide an opportunity to students who wish to explore the topics further.

### Late Homework
Late homework will suffer a penalty of 10% for every day they are late. For example, homework which is submitted two days late is worth at most 80% of the total credit.

In unusual circumstances, such as extreme illness or injury (documented by a doctor's note), family emergencies, etc., please contact the instructor as early as possible to arrange accomidations.

### Regrade Requests
I am happy to regrade any assignmentss or exam problems which you think were unfair or incorrect. Please bring me the original assignment, plus a written explanation of your question or complaint, within two weeks of the time the paper in question is graded and returned to you.
